# MovieMVCApplication
Thank you for taking the time to look at my resume projects! I'm still a bit new to GitHub and Git, so pardon the formatting :) .

## How To Use

## Overview
This is my main project on my resume (until my University Database Applicaiton is finished), an ASP.NET Core MVC web app. This app allows the user to manage and display a database of movie titles. In any MVC web app, the architecture is split into three main components:
- Models: Classes that represent that data of the app
- Views: Components that display the app's user interface
- Controllers: Classes that handle browser requests

This architectural split helps the creator split the different aspects of the app into business logic (models), UI logic (views), and input logic (controllers).
